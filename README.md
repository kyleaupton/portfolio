## Introduction

Welcome to my professional portfolio. This platform serves as a showcase for the various projects I have developed and contributed to. The site is built using a robust technology stack that includes Vite, Vue 3, and TypeScript, and is hosted on Netlify.

While the majority of the components on this site are custom-built, a few external libraries have been utilized to enhance functionality. These include `fitty` for dynamic landing animation sizing, `floating-vue` for tooltip management, and `marked` + `highlight.js` for rendering markdown READMEs.

## Continuous Deployment

The site is configured for Continuous Deployment (CD) via Netlify. Any commit to the `main` branch automatically triggers a new build, ensuring the live site is always up-to-date with the latest changes. For development purposes, a separate `develop` branch is maintained. This allows for committing and testing new changes without triggering a build on the live site.
