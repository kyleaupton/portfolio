# Portfolio Site of Kyle Upton

## Introduction

Welcome to my professional portfolio. This platform serves as a showcase for the various projects I have developed and contributed to. The site is built using a robust technology stack that includes Nuxt, Vue 3, and TypeScript, and is hosted on Vercel.

## Continuous Deployment

The site is configured for Continuous Deployment (CD) to Vercel. Any commit to the `main` branch automatically triggers a new build, ensuring the live site is always up-to-date with the latest changes. For development purposes, a separate `develop` branch is maintained. This allows for committing and testing new changes without triggering a build on the live site.
